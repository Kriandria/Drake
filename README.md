### About

An IRC bot written in D.

Drake is a basic IRC bot that im working on to coincide with myself learning [Dlang](http://dlang.org/ ). As my knowledge of the D language grows I will do my best to expand upon Drake and make its features and source code reflect said knowledge.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Log Chat history when told
- [ ] Yell at people for pasting directly into IRC and/or ping them with a link to gist
- [ ] Play "guess what? Chicken butt" ( Because why not? )
- [ ] Simple response when name is mentioned ( i.e. Display list of commands when "Drake help" is mentioned etc )
